title: About

I have been doing engineering for about 20 years. Professionally, I've developed digital signal processing (DSP), wireless communications and machine learning based embedded / SW products, so I'm a pretty hands-on person when it comes to building stuff. On the other hand, I've published conference papers / transactions journals and been holding industrial patents that have been commercialized, so I have always appreciated academic work and documenting ideas as much as I liked building products.

Later on in my career, I've become a technical manager and a director at Silion Valley companies to lead the development of touch-signal processing solutions and, later, broadband wireless radio protocol development at network Layer-2 for several companies for the last 8 years as of 2020. I've managed multi-million dollar (USD) projects with international teams across continents in very fast pacing environments, got very well equipped with the principals of SW development life cycle as well and delivered SW features that would bring in millions-of-dollars as revenue to the companies I worked for, so I know the power of engineering and how even the smallest ideas could lead to most brilliant solutions.

Anyhow, though I've been heavily involved in wireless telecom area for quite some time now, my appetize for machine learning never died. I kept reading, learning and dealing with ML problems on my own to have som fun after boring management work. At my spare times, I started writing a chat bot that would give me in-game recommendations while playing my favorite game "Leage of Legends", or in another case I've developed an HMM algorithm to predict the state of TCP congestion control algorithm in the Linux kernel given TCP traffic data collected in network layer-2  and finally delved into developing price forecast algorithms for the energy market.  

Anyhow, the all these fields are challenging no matter who you are or how much experience you have in the past. There are tens of books and thousands of papers to read to cover those spaces. Even simple equations took years berofe they started making sense to me. When I heard a college Professor, well-known in his area of work, confessing the same, I thought, everyone who enters these fields must have been feeling the same. Hence, I decided to write my own experiences in DSP, Wireless and ML as an attempt to simplify the material to let everyone get a grasp of the fundamental ideas even if they will never temper with the further details of some branches of these fields and remind some of the important stuff to myself. 

I will be writing some of the posts in my native language, Turkish, as a giveback to my own community hoping that the terminology in Turkish advances and "thinking science in our native language" becomes possible at some point.
