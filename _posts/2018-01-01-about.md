Who am I? 

Director by day. Engineer by design.

A DSP, Wireless, ML and AI enthusiastic. 

Linux, Vim, Open Source advocate. 

Last but not the least, a League of Legends player. 

Work experience includes development and managerial roles involving SaaS and Embedded SW and HW development, multi-national team management and cross-functional team coordination under severe time to market constraints. 

Academic experience includes a proven track record of technical research activities, patents and publications. 

I will be writing some of the posts in my native language, Turkish, as a giveback to my own community hoping that the terminology in Turkish advances and "thinking science in our native language" becomes possible at some point.
