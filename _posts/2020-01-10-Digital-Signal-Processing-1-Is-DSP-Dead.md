Emre: The whole industry seems to be shifting toward Artificial Intelligence (AI), 5G, Data Science, and Machine Learning. What does that mean for the Digital Signal Processing (DSP) crowd? Is DSP dead?

Kaan: Good question. We should think of DSP both as a discipline and as a technology. Let’s take a look at each.

In fact, let me try to explain by asking you a reverse question.

Why do we need the discipline of signal processing in the first place ― why do we process signals at all?

Emre: To model and analyse physical phenomena as signals.

Kaan: Exactly. In other words, we process signals to *understand* them through physical models.

For example, we take a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of a signal to analyse it in the frequency domain. Looking at a spectrum helps us detect patterns or perform filtering. Other times we compress a signal, or use multi-rate processing to change its sampling frequency. The list goes on. The point is that we try to *understand* signals by decomposing them in various domains or expressing them via mathematical series.

Now, what is the goal of Machine Learning?

Emre: As the name implies, to *learn*.

Kaan: Right, but to learn *what*?

Emre: The model hidden in the data.

Kaan: Precisely ― to learn the data-driven model without necessarily *understanding* the underlying physics.

You may wonder how that is possible, but that is the beauty of machine learning. Deep-learning methods can *learn* and classify signals using relatively simple mathematics, sometimes performing better than decades of sophisticated signal-processing techniques that try to *understand* those signals. So ML is often more effective for classification problems. But classification is only a small portion of the overall problem space; many tasks still require pure signal-processing methods.

Emre: Isn’t there a paradox here? How can machine learning learn better without understanding?

Kaan: Deep learning’s mathematical framework is built for classification from the outset ― like a special-purpose machine. Signal-processing methods, on the other hand, rely on analysing or modelling everything as linear systems, backed by heavy math theorems. Non-linear analyses exist but quickly get complicated, spawning innumerable specialised methods. Deep learning skips that analysis layer and has far fewer underlying theories. In fact, saying that researchers *still* cannot fully explain how a deep network classifies would not be unfair.

Emre: So we will still need both disciplines but in different regions of the problem space?

Kaan: Yes and no. If learning alone suffices, we can stick to machine learning. But other problems demand *understanding* the signal, so we fall back on DSP. Sometimes we need a union of both. For instance, recognising that the Expectation–Maximisation (EM) algorithm is an approximate maximum-likelihood estimator under a Gaussian-noise assumption ― what if the noise isn’t Gaussian? How do we model a new distribution?
